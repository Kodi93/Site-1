AWS Blogs Security and governance teams across all environments face a common challenge: translating abstract security and governance requirements into a concrete, integrated control framework. AWS services provide capabilities that organizations can use to implement controls across multiple layers of their architecture—from infrastructure provisioning to runtime monitoring. Many organizations deploy multi-account environments with AWS Control Tower , or Landing Zone Accelerator to implement a foundational baseline of controls and security architecture. Once their environment is provisioned, organizations typically look to add additional detective controls from services such as AWS Security Hub and AWS Config based on security, compliance, and operational requirements. While this sequence is a great start, there are more opportunities during this time to implement layered defense-in-depth coverage to enhance your security posture. Highly regulated industries such as fintech and financial services are often viewed as the gold standard for governance and security controls. While these sectors have established robust frameworks, there’s consistently room for improvement and valuable lessons for other industries looking to enhance their control environments. However, many organizations struggle to move beyond a basic compliance-focused approach. In our experience working with customers across various sectors, this limited perspective often stems from multiple factors, including: The good news? A more comprehensive approach that uses AWS preventative, proactive, detective, and responsive controls can significantly reduce risk while decreasing operational overhead through automation. In this post, we outline a practical framework that you can adopt to evolve your security and governance controls strategy. We explore how your organization can mature from a detection-focused security posture to a multi-layered control framework, using real-world examples across the resource lifecycle, including infrastructure-as-code testing and preventative controls such as service control policies (SCPs), resource control policies (RCPs), and declarative policies (DPs). Drawing from best practices in highly regulated industries while incorporating modern cloud capabilities through services such as AWS Organizations and AWS Control Tower, we provide a structured framework that you can use to elevate your organization’s control environment beyond basic compliance requirements. Organizations face several significant challenges when attempting to implement a comprehensive control framework in AWS. Let’s explore the main obstacles: Security teams often find themselves caught between limited resources and expanding responsibilities in the cloud. With constrained budgets and personnel, teams typically gravitate toward quick wins through detective controls, which appear straightforward to implement initially. While this provides immediate visibility, it can leave critical gaps in security posture. Many teams lack comprehensive expertise across all control types, particularly in implementing preventative, proactive, and responsive controls effectively. The pressure to demonstrate immediate security improvements, combined with day-to-day operational demands, frequently results in tactical solutions rather than strategic, layered security approaches. Deciding which tools to prioritize can be a challenge; the breadth of options and extensive capabilities available across AWS security services and third-party tools can feel overwhelming at times. Security teams struggle to determine the optimal mix of controls for their environment and where to begin implementation. This challenge is compounded by the complexity of mapping technical compliance requirements to cloud-focused capabilities and maintaining visibility into emerging threats as the security landscape evolves. The layers of abstraction created by proliferating security controls can further obscure clear decision-making, leading teams to delay critical security improvements while seeking perfect solutions. Defense in depth as a concept is good, but it can be misunderstood and difficult to achieve, leading to vulnerabilities in the security architecture. A common misconception is that a single strong control, separation of duties in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, least permission in IAM policies, and so on, provide sufficient protection. This overlooks the crucial value of implementing controls at multiple points and how different control types can be combined to create a robust security posture. Teams often miss how organizational controls like SCPs can work in harmony with workload-specific controls to achieve greater protection. The role of preventative controls in guiding technical implementations is frequently under appreciated. The path to security maturity presents numerous obstacles. Many organizations remain stuck in the early stages, implementing detective controls but never progressing to preventative measures. Security controls are often implemented in isolation, without consideration for the broader security landscape. Organizations struggle to create and follow a clear roadmap for evolving their security posture, and measuring improvement over time proves challenging. As AWS environments grow, maintaining consistent governance and security becomes increasingly complex. Organizations face mounting challenges in managing exceptions and special cases across their expanding infrastructure. These interrelated challenges often result in controls implementations that fail to achieve their intended risk reduction goals. You need a structured approach to overcome these obstacles and implement comprehensive security controls, which we explore in the following sections. While implementing comprehensive controls requires an initial investment in time and resources, the long-term benefits fundamentally transform how organizations operate. The foundation for this transformation begins with establishing baseline controls through proven starting points such as AWS Control Tower and its customization options. AWS Control Tower provides building blocks for secure multi-account architectures with hundreds of security capabilities and proactive controls already built in. Rather than trying to create baselines from scratch by wrangling vast amounts of account-level or resource-specific controls, you can use these accelerators to rapidly establish
