## Details
Talos IR associates specific adversary actions with pre-ransomware activity. When threat actors attempt to gain enterprise-level domain administrator access, they often conduct a series of account pivots and escalations, deploy command-and-control (C2) or other remote access solutions, harvest credentials and/or deploy automation to execute the modification of the OS. Though the specific tools or elements in the attack chain vary by adversary, Talos IR has seen these same classic steps in practice for years. These actions, along with observed indicators of compromise (IOCs) or tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that we associate with known ransomware threats without the end result of enterprise-wide encryption, lead us to categorize an incident as “pre-ransomware.” It is worth noting that some of the above attack techniques are also often deployed by initial access brokers (IABs) who seek to gain and sell access to compromised systems, and it is possible some of the incidents involved in this case study could have therefore been perpetrated by IABs instead of ransomware operators. While it is often challenging to determine a threat actor’s end goal, we have high confidence that all incidents involved tactics are consistently seen preceding ransomware deployment. If the adversary was instead an IAB, we have seen these types of IAB campaigns very frequently result in a ransomware attack after access has been sold, rendering the activity relevant to this analysis. Talos analyzed incident response engagements spanning the past two and a half years that we categorized as pre-ransomware attacks, identifying actions and security measures that we assessed were key in halting adversaries’ attack chains before encryption. An overview of our findings can be found in Figure 1, followed by a more thorough breakdown of each category to explore exactly how certain actions impeded ransomware execution. Engaging Talos IR within one to two days of first observed adversary activity (though we advise engagement as quickly as possible) was credited with preventing a more serious ransomware attack in approximately a third of engagements, providing benefits such as: We observed numerous incidents where Talos IR was not engaged by the customer immediately, which enabled the adversary to continue working through their attack chain and conduct data theft and/or ransomware deployment. This often results in consequences such as backup files being corrupted or encrypted, endpoint detection and response (EDR) and other security tools being disabled, disruption to day-to-day operations and more. Vigilant monitoring of security solutions and logs allows network administrators to act quickly when a threat is first detected, isolate the malicious activity and cut off threat actors’ ability to escalate their attack. In our case study, action from the security team within two hours of an alert from the organization’s EDR or managed detection and response (MDR) solution correlated with successful isolation of the threat in almost a third of engagements. Some of the observed alerts that prompted swift response in pre-ransomware engagements included, amongst others: In almost 15 percent of engagements, targeted organizations were able to get ahead of the threat to their environment due to notification from U.S. government (USG) partners and representatives of their managed service provider (MSP) about possible ransomware staging in their environment. In particular, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has launched an initiative to provide early warnings about potential ransomware attacks, aiming to help organizations detect threats and evict actors before significant damage occurs. CISA’s intelligence predominately derives from their partnerships with the cybersecurity research community, infrastructure providers and cyber threat intelligence companies. In over 10 percent of Talos IR engagements, customers’ security solutions actively blocked and/or quarantined malicious executables, effectively stopping adversaries’ attack chains in their tracks. Talos often observes organizations deploying endpoint protection technology in a passive manner, meaning the product is producing alerts to the user but not taking other actions. This configuration puts organizations at unnecessary risk, and Talos IR has responded to multiple engagements where passive deployment enabled threat actors to execute malware, including ransomware. A more aggressive configuration impeded ransomware deployment in this case study, underscoring its importance. Based on our analysis, organizations’ robust security restrictions were key in impeding ransomware actors’ attack chains in nine percent of engagements. For example, in one engagement, the threat actors compromised a service account at the targeted organization, but appropriate privilege restrictions on the account prevented their attempts to access key systems like domain controllers. Also of note, organizations who implemented thorough logging and/or had a SIEM in place to aggregate event data were able to provide Talos with forensic visibility to determine the exact chain of events and where additional security measures could be implemented. When an organization lacks these records, it can be challenging to identify the precise security weaknesses that enabled threat activity. Upon categorizing TTPs observed in this case study per the MITRE ATT&CK framework, Talos found that the following in Figure 2 were most frequently seen across engagements. We dove deeper into some of the top attack techniques and found the following: The top observed TTPs serve as a reminder to security teams on what malicious activity often preempts a more severe attack. For example, prioritizing moderating the use of remote services and remote access software and/or securing the aforementioned credential stores could assist in limiting the majority of adversaries seen in these pre-ransomware engagements. Talos IR crafts security recommendations for customers in each incident upon analyzing the environment and the adversary’s attack chain to help address any existing security weaknesses. Our most frequent recommendations include: What happens when you bring in a team of cybersecurity responders? How do we turn chaos into control, and what is the long-term value that Talos IR provides to the organizations we work with? With a Cisco Talos IR Retainer, your
