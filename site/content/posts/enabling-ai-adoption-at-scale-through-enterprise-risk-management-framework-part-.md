AWS Blogs In Part 1 of this series , we explored the fundamental risks and governance considerations. In this part, we examine practical strategies for adapting your enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) to harness generative AI’s power while maintaining robust controls. This part covers: By the end of this post, you’ll have a roadmap for scaling generative AI adoption securely and responsibly. Before diving into generative AI-specific controls, it’s crucial to understand the fundamental infrastructure that enables these technologies. Cloud computing is the foundational infrastructure that has made generative AI possible and accessible at scale. The development and deployment of large language models and other generative AI systems require massive computational resources, vast amounts of data storage, and sophisticated distributed processing capabilities that cloud systems can efficiently provide. Cloud technology differs from on-premises IT solutions, and the relationship between financial institutions and cloud service providers is also different from the relationship with a traditional outsourcing provider. These differences change the nature of many risks that financial institutions face and how they manage them. However, if cloud technology is implemented in the right way, it can reduce risk and provide tools to help Chief Risk Officers (CROs) to manage risk too. You can read more about how your ERMF needs to change for large scale cloud adoption in Is your Enterprise Risk Management Framework ready for the Cloud? Organizations adopting generative AI can use their enterprise risk management framework to realize business value while maintaining appropriate controls. This approach allows you to build on existing risk management practices while addressing generative AI’s unique characteristics. For a structured approach to cloud-enabled AI transformation, the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework for AI, ML, and generative AI (AWS CAF for AI) provides detailed implementation guidance aligned with enterprise risk management principles. For a detailed user guide, see AWS User Guide to Governance, Risk and Compliance for Responsible AI Adoption within Financial Services Industries , available in AWS Artifact using your AWS sign in. AWS Artifact provides AWS security and compliance reports, helping organizations maintain compliance through best practices. When it comes to model management and the AI system lifecycle, customers can consult ISO42001 AI Management, Section A6 . This section encompasses capturing the objective and processes for the responsible design and development of AI systems, including criteria and requirements for each stage of the AI system life cycle. This guidance can help organizations verify that their model management practices align with industry standards for responsible AI development. From a business leader’s perspective, incorporating generative AI considerations into your ERMF helps establish documented good practices, implement effective controls, and maintain transparency about usage across the enterprise. This enables both responsible innovation and prudent risk management. Here’s how organizations are approaching this: In the field of generative AI, organizations establish both guardrails for innovation and clear accountability for risk management. The three lines of defense model provides the structure for implementing these foundational elements: Building on the three lines of defense model discussed earlier, organizations can adapt their risk management practices to address the unique characteristics of generative AI while using industry best practices and frameworks. This often involves evolving existing controls and introducing new ones specific to generative AI. AWS services have built-in capabilities that support these enhanced governance, risk management, and compliance requirements, helping organizations to implement controlled and responsible generative AI solutions. This includes, for example, Amazon Bedrock Guardrails , among many others. Building on the risk areas we outlined earlier, we now explore how organizations can implement controls for each of these areas. For each, we describe the principle and the practical implementation considerations. While organizations might prioritize these areas differently based on their use cases and risk appetite, together they provide a framework for responsible generative AI adoption through ERMF. While we explore high-level control principles that follow, technical teams can review the AWS Well-Architected Framework – Generative AI Lens for detailed architectural guidance that supports these governance objectives. Generative AI systems can deliver equitable outcomes across different stakeholder groups, helping organizations build trust and meet expectations. Organizations can support this by setting up clear fairness metrics for specific use cases, regularly assessing training data for bias, and closely monitoring performance across different groups. For high-stakes applications, additional checks can help facilitate fair treatment across diverse populations. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides configurable safeguards to help maintain fair and unbiased outputs, with customizable thresholds to match different use case requirements. Amazon Bedrock provides comprehensive model evaluation tools including model cards with detailed bias metrics, to assess bias across demographic groups. Amazon Bedrock includes built-in prompt datasets like the Bias in Open-ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD), which automatically evaluates fairness across key areas such as profession, gender, race, and various ideologies. These capabilities integrate with Amazon SageMaker Clarify for comprehensive bias detection and mitigation, supported by built-in bias metrics and reporting. Generative AI systems can provide understanding of their decision-making processes, supporting accountability and effective oversight. Explainability is essential for all generative AI systems—whether using custom-built or pre-built models, particularly for complex models like transformer networks. Organizations can implement practical controls by establishing clear explainability thresholds based on use case risk levels. This remains an active industry challenge, with ongoing research and evolving approaches. For critical business applications, tailoring explanations to different stakeholders while maintaining accuracy can improve understandi
