AWS Blogs July 28, 2025 : This post has been updated and expanded into a comprehensive two-part series covering multiple AWS file sharing solutions. This new series provides in-depth analysis of security and cost considerations to help you make informed decisions based on your requirements. Note: This is Part 1 of a two-part post. You can read Part 2 here . Sharing files with an outside entity—to share data between business partners or facilitate customer access to files—is a common use case for Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers. Organizations must balance security, cost, and usability. In a business-to-business data sharing scenario, these challenges become even more complex because human interaction is often minimal or absent, requiring robust automated solutions. Many AWS services offer multiple options for granting access. The one that’s best for your use case depends on multiple factors. This post helps you decide which AWS services to use to implement a file sharing approach that suits your business needs. We focus on security controls and cost implications, describe some of the trade-offs, and highlight key differences to help you make an informed decision based on your specific requirements. We go through each option, highlighting their strengths and limitations, and provide guidance on choosing the right solution for your use case. The first step in designing an AWS file sharing solution is to develop a clear understanding of your requirements and constraints. Because there are several possible design patterns and a number of different AWS services to consider, you need to start by identifying and prioritizing the features that you need. Gather the following information to guide your approach: When planning for access patterns and scale, there are a few key factors to keep in mind. First, consider how files are shared—machine-to-machine, human-to-machine, or human-to-human—because that impacts security and performance. Then, think about transfer frequency—are files exchanged only once a day, or are thousands moving every hour? If download control matters, setting limits on how often a file can be accessed might be necessary. File sizes also play a role, from typical everyday transfers to the largest files you need to support. Finally, total data volume shapes how much information you’ll be transferring on a regular basis. Your choice of solution will be influenced by technical constraints and capabilities. Protocol requirements often drive initial decisions, such as whether you need SFTP, FTPS, or HTTPS access. Consider existing systems that must interface with your solution and how they’ll connect. Performance considerations span several dimensions: acceptable latency for file transfers, geographic distribution of your users, bandwidth requirements, and whether you need built-in retry mechanisms for failed transfers. Additionally, think about how many simultaneous transfers your solution needs to support. Security and compliance requirements will definitely influence your file sharing strategy. Consider who controls encryption keys—whether managed by AWS or your organization—and what key rotation policies are needed. Authentication needs often vary—you might be authenticating individual users, specific systems, or entire business entities, using methods ranging from passwords to API keys, multi-factor authentication, or certificates. Your audit requirements will influence your choices in logging and monitoring capabilities. You might have geographic considerations like data sovereignty requirements, storage location restrictions, and access controls that consider the recipient’s location. If your data is subject to a law, like GDPR in Europe or HIPAA in the United States, or if your data is regulated by a standard like the Payment Card Industry’s Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), you will need to consult with your own legal and compliance advisors to see what is required. When assessing risk tolerance, consider the security triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability—some use cases might tolerate brief periods of unavailability but cannot risk data exposure, while others prioritize continuous availability. Day-to-day operations bring their own set of considerations. File retention policies determine how long data needs to be kept, while auto-deletion capabilities might be necessary for managing storage and compliance. Consider what kind of reporting and monitoring of file transfer activities you need. Do you need monthly reports, daily reports or perhaps detailed real-time tracking of transfer activities. By adding handling and notification systems, you can help make sure that problems are caught and addressed promptly. Disaster recovery requirements, expressed through recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO), help determine the resilience needed in your solution. Your solution must operate within your business constraints, such as budget limitations, technical limitations, timelines, available expertise, and service level agreements (SLAs). Budget limitations include initial implementation costs and ongoing operational expenses. Consider other parties’ technical limitations—they might use specific protocols such as SFTP, require mobile device compatibility, or operate older systems that have limited cryptographic capabilities. Implementation timelines influence choices between managed services that can be deployed quickly and custom solutions that require more time and expertise. The expertise available for solution maintenance is also a consideration. SLAs for file transfers might specify availability and performance requirements that you’re obligated to meet. To meet these constraints, you must estimate how much your file sharing needs will grow over time and determine if you need a regional or a global solution. By carefully considering these aspects, you’ll be better prepared to evaluate different AWS file sharing solutions and select the one that best fits your use case. Understanding your requirements for uploads and downloads will help determine if your use case can be supported through a single AWS service or needs a combination of services. Let’s start by looking at the various file sharing mechanisms that AWS supports. The following table identifies the key AWS services needed for each solution, describes the security and cost implications of the solutions, and describes their complexity and protocol support capabilitie
