AWS Blogs Security threats demand swift action, which is why AWS Security Incident Response delivers AWS-native protection that can immediately strengthen your security posture. This comprehensive solution combines automated triage and evaluation logic with your security perimeter metadata to identify critical issues, seamlessly bringing in human expertise when needed. When Security Incident Response is integrated with Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub within a unified security environment, organizations gain 24/7 access to the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) for rapid detection, expert analysis, and efficient threat containment—managed through one intuitive console. Security Incident Response is included with Amazon Managed Services (AMS) , which helps organizations adopt and operate AWS at scale efficiently and securely. In this post, we guide you through enabling Security Incident Response and executing a proof of concept (POC) to quickly enhance your security capabilities while realizing immediate benefits. We explore the service’s functionality, establish POC success criteria, define your configuration, prepare for deployment, enable the service, and optimize effectiveness from day one, helping your organization build confidence throughout the incident response lifecycle while improving recovery time. AWS Security Incident Response service provides comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities through a streamlined four-step process. It begins by ingesting security findings from GuardDuty and select Security Hub integrations with third-party tools. The service then automatically triages these findings using customer metadata and threat intelligence to identify anomalous behavior and suspicious activities. When potential threats are detected, CIRT members proactively investigate cases through the customer portal to determine whether they are true or false positives. For confirmed threats, the service escalates findings for immediate action, while false positives trigger updates to the auto-triage system and suppression rules for GuardDuty and Security Hub, continuously improving detection accuracy. Security Incident Response delivers powerful security capabilities through seamless integration with both the AWS threat detection and incident response (TDIR) system and third-party security services such as CrowdStrike, Lacework, and TrendMicro. This solution provides a unified command center for end-to-end incident management—from planning and communication to resolution—while ingesting GuardDuty findings and integrating with external providers through Security Hub. With secure case management and an immutable activity timeline, it significantly enhances your security operations by augmenting your security operations center (SOC) and incident response (IR) teams with improved visibility and access to AWS-proven tools and personnel. The AWS CIRT works collaboratively with your responders during investigations and recovery, freeing your valuable resources for other priorities. The service delivers continuous value through proactive monitoring and response capabilities. It constantly monitors your environment using GuardDuty and Security Hub findings, with service automation, triage, and analysis working diligently in the background to alert you only for genuine security concerns. This protection provides immediate value during potential incidents without demanding your constant attention. Getting started is straightforward—the only prerequisite is having AWS Organizations enabled and making sure that you have established Organizations with a fundamental organizational unit (OU) structure encompassing member accounts. This foundation not only enables Security Incident Response deployment but also serves as the cornerstone for implementing a robust TDIR strategy across your organization. Establishing success criteria helps benchmark the outcomes of the POC with the goals of the business. Some example criteria include: Review your success criteria to make sure that your goals are realistic given your timeframe and potential constraints that are specific to your organization. For example, do you have full control over the configuration of AWS services that are deployed in an organization? Do you have resources that can dedicate time to implement and test? Is this time convenient for relevant stakeholders to evaluate the service? After establishing your success criteria and timeline, it’s best practice to define your Security Incident Response configuration. Some important decisions include the following: After determining success criteria and Security Incident Response configuration, identify stakeholders, desired state, and timeframe. Prepare for deployment by completing: With preparations in place, you are ready to enable the service. Access Security Incident Response in the management account: Complete setup in the delegated administrator account: Detailed instructions can be found in the YouTube setup video . Many organizations have well-established processes and application suites for IR and security threat management. To accommodate these pre-existing setups, AWS has developed integrations with popular ITSM and case management applications. Our initial releases enable complete bi-directional integration with both Jira and ServiceNow, with more on the way. We have provided comprehensive instructions to guide you through the setup process in GitHub . Immediately after enabling the service, Security Incident Response begins to ingest your GuardDuty and Security Hub findings (from security partners). Your findings are automatically triaged and monitored using deterministic evaluation logic; based on your organization’s unique metadata and security perimeter, high-priority threats are escalated to your Security Incident Response command center for immediate investigation. While your organization receives 24/7 coverage from the start, implementing these recommended optimizations will significantly enhance threat detection accuracy, reduce false positives, accelerate response times, and strengthen your overall security posture through customized protection aligned with your specific business risks and compliance requirements. To maximize immediate value from Security Incident Response, we suggest using its reactive capabilities beginning at day one. When your team encounters suspicious activities or requires expert investigation, you can create an AWS-suppor
