AWS Blogs August 1, 2024: This post was republished to remove incorrect references to AWS WAF and Shield. Organizations face mounting challenges in building and maintaining effective security incident response programs. Studies from IBM and Morning Consult show security teams face two major challenges: over 50 percent of security alerts go unaddressed because of resource constraints and alert fatigue, while false positives consume 30 percent of investigation time, delaying responses to true positive threats According to the 2024 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report , organizations now take an average of 258 days to identify and contain security events. The report also reveals that nearly half of SOC teams report increased detection and response times over the past two years, with 80 percent indicating that manual threat investigation significantly impacts their response times. Despite these challenges, according to the 2024 IBM Security Services Benchmark Report, organizations with mature incident response capabilities demonstrate a 50 percent reduction in mean time to resolution (MTTR) and achieve cost savings of up to 58 percent per incident. These improvements are driven by the adoption of automated workflows, integrated tools, and streamlined communication processes that accelerate threat detection and containment. In this post, we walk you through a real-world scenario to show how AWS Security Incident Response can immediately generate benefits by accelerating every step of your incident response lifecycle, how it integrates with other native AWS services such as Amazon GuardDuty , AWS Security Hub , and AWS Systems Manager , and how to integrate third-party threat detection findings for inclusion in your automated monitoring, triage, and containment capabilities. AWS Security Incident Response is a Tier 1 service that launched in December 2024. The service is an AWS-native, purpose-built security incident response solution for customers that can be used as a better-together experience with other AWS services in the areas of detection and response (GuardDuty and Security Hub), and management and governance (Systems Manager). AWS Security Incident Response is also integrated across AWS Partners through a service specific Partner Specialization program. More detailed information is available in the AWS Security Incident Response documentation . AWS Security Incident Response complements existing services by enhancing your security posture through streamlined incident management capabilities before, during, and after security events. AWS Security Incident Response addresses three common challenges: AWS Security Incident Response complements and integrates with AWS security services to provide comprehensive incident response capabilities. The service works seamlessly with: This integration helps you build efficient incident response capabilities that can minimize the time, cost, and impact of security events throughout your organization’s cloud journey, while helping to reduce investments in additional staffing, training, and tool maintenance. The AWS Security Incident Response service offers: Before implementing the capabilities described in this post, make sure that you have: These prerequisites help make sure that you can fully utilize the service’s automated detection, triage, and response capabilities. The service provides automated monitoring and analysis capabilities within its own service infrastructure, enabling automatic triage of findings from GuardDuty and Security Hub. For automated containment actions in your AWS accounts, you must first deploy the required CloudFormation StackSets and configure the appropriate IAM permissions. This helps make sure that you maintain full control over automated actions taken in your environment while benefiting from the service’s detection capabilities. This automation can be customized based on variables you establish, such as known CIDR ranges (specific ranges of IP addresses that define your network) and IP addresses, and you can implement GuardDuty suppression rules to help reduce false positives and alert volumes. As a result, the service can serve as a powerful augmentation to your existing security incident response programs and tools. Your cloud administrator, with AWSSecurityIncidentResponseFullAccess permissions, has established the incident response team in the service. The service notifies individuals, your partners or managed security service provider (MSSP), and other contacts added to the team, supporting a rapid escalation to alert the required parties and respond to the event. As a best practice, your team establishes minimal privileges for accessing and managing information within AWS Security Incident Response cases. This helps make sure that team members have appropriate access levels to case details, findings, and investigation data while maintaining security and compliance requirements. AWS Security Incident Response provides multiple API actions, such as CreateCaseComment (to add notes to investigations) and GetCase (to retrieve case metadata), to limit whom and which actions can be performed against differing cases. For development and testing environments, AWS provides role-based policies that you can use such as AWSSecurityIncidentResponseCaseFullAccess and AWSSecurityIncidentResponseReadOnlyAccess for role-based access control (as shown in Figure 1). For production environments, we recommend creating custom IAM policies following the principle of least privilege based on your security requirements. Figure 1: Permissions policies for security incident response Following your configuration of the AWS Security Incident Response service, your security team reviews the email distribution list or alias for notifications for notifications from the service, as shown in Figure 2. You have developed items in your backlog to take advantage of Amazon EventBridge integrations to add in pager duty, Jira, and other services in the future for additional notification mechanisms. Figure 2: Use the console to manage your incident response team membership At 2:00 AM, days after AWS Security Incident Response has been set up, the service detects a combination of suspicious activities through GuardDuty findings, including anomalous IAM user behavior (such as shown in Figure 3), unusual API calls from unknown IP addresses, and a surge of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance creations that deviate from your account’s
