Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter. Last week I flew 5,000 miles to Las Vegas for Black Hat USA. After navigating the casino carpet labyrinth and finding the only venue in Nevada that serves a proper English breakfast tea with milk (lifesaver), I’ve decided Black Hat feels exactly like trying to run in a dream — you’re always heading somewhere, never quickly, and the water costs $8. I don’t mean to complain (although, as a Brit, I’m practically obligated to file a formal grievance about the weather, tea or queue length). In truth, it was a brilliant week, and I got to watch my fellow Talosians deliver some outstanding presentations and research. Rather than recap everything we did (our YouTube channel will have plenty of research highlights soon), here are three standouts: We’ll have more to share soon, including a behind-the-scenes tour of the Black Hat Network Operations Center (NOC). Cisco Talos has identified a widespread malvertising campaign distributing a multi-stage malware framework Talos calls “PS1Bot,” which uses PowerShell and C# modules to steal sensitive information, log keystrokes, capture screenshots, and maintain persistent access on infected systems. PS1Bot employs in-memory execution and modular updates, targeting browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and more, while minimizing its footprint to evade detection. The campaign has been active and rapidly evolving throughout 2025. Casual browsing and downloading seemingly safe files can lead to infection, putting your personal data, passwords and financial info at risk — especially if you use cryptocurrency wallets or save passwords in browsers. Be extra cautious when downloading files from search results or ads, keep your security software updated, and use dedicated password managers and security tools instead of storing sensitive info in browsers. Stay informed about evolving threats like PS1Bot, as attackers are constantly updating their tactics. Talos' blog also provides Snort SIDs and ClamAV detections. Russian government hackers said to be behind US federal court filing system hack The Russian government is allegedly behind the data breach affecting the U.S. court filing system known as PACER, according to The New York Times. ( TechCrunch ) North Korean Kimsuky hackers exposed in alleged data breach The North Korean state-sponsored hacking group known as Kimsuky has reportedly suffered a data breach after two hackers stole the group's data and leaked it publicly online. ( Bleeping Computer ) Exclusive: Brosix and Chatox promised to keep your chats secured. They didn’t. A researcher contacted DataBreaches after finding an unsecured backup with 155.3 GB of unique compressed files. The researcher first logged the backup as exposed in late April. ( DataBreaches ) Netherlands: Citrix Netscaler flaw CVE-2025-6543 exploited to breach orgs The Netherlands' National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is warning that a critical Citrix NetScaler vulnerability was exploited to breach "critical organizations" in the country. ( Bleeping Computer ) Russian hackers exploited WinRAR zero-day in attacks on Europe, Canada A Russian threat group has been observed exploiting a WinRAR zero-day vulnerability (now patched) as part of a cyberespionage campaign aimed at organizations in Europe and Canada.

Bill takes thoughtful look at the transition from summer camp to grind season, explores the importance of mental health and reflects on AI psychiatry. This week, Joe encourages you to find your community in cybersecurity and make the effort to grow, network and hack stuff together. © Cisco Systems, Inc. and/or its affiliates. All rights
