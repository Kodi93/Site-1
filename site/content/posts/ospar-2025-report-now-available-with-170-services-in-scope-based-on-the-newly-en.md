AWS Blogs We’re pleased to announce the completion of our annual AWS Outsourced Service Provider’s Audit Report (OSPAR) audit cycle on August 7, 2025, based on the newly enhanced version 2.0 guidelines (OSPAR v2.0). AWS is the first global cloud service provider in Singapore to obtain the report using the new OSPAR v2.0 guidelines. The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) established the Guidelines on Control Objectives and Procedures for Outsourced Service Providers (ABS Guidelines) to provide baseline controls criteria that outsourced service providers (OSPs) operating in Singapore should have in place. ABS enhanced the ABS Guidelines to version 2.0, which OSPs—such as AWS—need to comply with for the audit period commencing on or after January 1, 2025. The enhanced ABS Guidelines integrate key elements from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulatory updates on cyber hygiene, technology risk management, and business continuity management, and include new control domains such as data security, cryptography, software application development and management, and business continuity management. The 2025 OSPAR certification cycle includes the addition of seven new services in scope, bringing the total number of services in scope to 170 in the AWS Asia Pacific (Singapore) Region. Newly added services in scope include the following: Successfully completing the OSPAR assessment demonstrates that AWS continues to maintain a robust system of controls to meet these guidelines. This underscores our commitment to fulfill the security expectations for cloud service providers set by the financial services industry in Singapore.Customers can use OSPAR to streamline their due diligence processes, thereby reducing the effort and costs associated with compliance. OSPAR remains a core assurance program for our financial services customers because it is closely aligned with local regulatory requirements from MAS. You can download the latest OSPAR report from AWS Artifact , a self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports. Sign in to AWS Artifact in the AWS Management Console , or learn more at Getting Started with AWS Artifact . The list of services in scope for OSPAR is available in the report, and is also available on the AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program webpage. As always, we’re committed to bringing new services into the scope of our OSPAR program based on your architectural and regulatory needs.
